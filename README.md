Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is part of my 20 AI Projects Series and represents Project 6. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes.
Project Overview
The project uses the heart.csv dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, prepares the data for training, builds a Logistic Regression model, evaluates its performance, and finally makes predictions on new input data.
Steps Performed
Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas
Inspected data structure with functions like info, describe, and value_counts
Checked for missing values and prepared the feature set
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split
Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training data
Evaluated accuracy on both training and testing sets
Used the trained model to make predictions on custom input data
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Model Output
The model predicts binary outcomes:
1: Person has heart disease
0: Person does not have heart disease
Status
This project is completed as part of AI Project 6/20. I will now continue to Project 7 while balancing my new internship.
